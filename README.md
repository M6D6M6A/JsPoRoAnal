> [!Note]
> Since there was some unnecessary drama regarding the so-called `RogueEditor`, I decided to just make my own account modification tool from scratch, based only on the [source code](https://github.com/pagefaultgames/pokerogue). My goal is to focus on adding new features that do not exist yet, with a nice **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**).
